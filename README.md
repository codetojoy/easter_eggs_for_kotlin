### Introduction

"Easter Eggs" does not refer to the secret-codes/tricks in video games! 

Define an 'egg' to be a [foothold example](http://sscce.org) that helps illustrate Kotlin. I like to keep examples around for reference, and want to share. 

Most examples are done entirely in tests. (Some are true unit tests and others are closer to integration tests)

### Requirements

* assumes Gradle is installed
